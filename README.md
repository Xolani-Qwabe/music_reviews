# DeMusic_Reviews

## Overview
Our decentralized music label leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, community-driven music ownership and promotion platform. Artists can stake streaming rights via NFTs to raise funds for promotion and branding, while fans engage in the music selection process through upvotes and social media campaigns. NFTs include streaming royalties, event passes, merchandise, and other perks, creating new revenue streams for artists and investment opportunities for fans.

## Key Features
- **NFT-based streaming rights staking** to fund promotions.
- **Community-driven music selection** through upvotes (R10 per vote).
- **Transparent dispute resolution** via NFT holder voting.
- **Task-based execution** for service providers with verified payments.
- **Integration with streaming platforms** like Apple Music and YouTube Music.

## Key Players

- **Fans:** Upvote songs, engage in social media campaigns, and purchase NFTs.
- **Service Providers:** Execute marketing, branding, and technical tasks.
